In my bubble it's always been common knowledge that a database connection over a Unix socket is faster
than that same connection over a TCP connection.

But does this boat still float when using the Google recommended way to access Cloud SQL 
from GKE: with Google Cloud Proxy as a sidecar in a pod? *Since Cloud Proxy moves data over a TCP tunnel, 
speed should be identical.*

So to save everyone a little time, I did some very minimal benchmarking:

# Setup

(If you want to replicate this; remember to fill in `connection_name`, `username` and `password`.)

## Unix Socket
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pgbench
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pgbench
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pgbench
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: cloudsql-proxy
          image: gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy
          command: ["/cloud_sql_proxy",
                    "--dir=/cloudsql",
                    "-instances=<connection_name>",
                    "-credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/service-account-credentials.json"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: cloudsql-instance-credentials
              mountPath: /secrets/cloudsql
              readOnly: true
            - name: cloudsql-sockets
              mountPath: /cloudsql
        - name: benchapp
          image: postgres
          command: ["pgbench", "-h", "/cloudsql", "-U", "<username>", "-d", "<dbname>", "-c", "5", "-T", "30"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: cloudsql-sockets
              mountPath: /cloudsql
      volumes:
        - name: cloudsql-instance-credentials
          secret:
            secretName: service-account-credentials
        - name: cloudsql-sockets
          emptyDir: {}
```

## TCP Port
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pgbench
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pgbench
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pgbench
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: cloudsql-proxy
          image: gcr.io/cloudsql-docker/gce-proxy
          command: ["/cloud_sql_proxy",
                    "-instances=<connection_name>=tcp:127.0.0.1:5432",
                    "-credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/service-account-credentials.json"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: cloudsql-instance-credentials
              mountPath: /secrets/cloudsql
              readOnly: true
        - name: pgbench
          image: postgres
          command: ["pgbench", "-h", "localhost:5432", "-U", "<username>", "-d", "<dbname>", "-c", "5", "-T", "30"]
      volumes:
        - name: cloudsql-instance-credentials
          secret:
            secretName: service-account-credentials
```

# Conclusion

In my 2(!) tests sockets are about 7% faster; which surprised me a bit. I leave it up to you to decide 
whether that's enough to switch if you're currently using TCP. You should probably check it in your 
own cluster.
